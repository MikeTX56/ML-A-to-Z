# **Machine Learning A-to-Z**

This repository documents a complete, hands-on journey through machine
learning.\
It includes small, focused projects, mathematical derivations,
experiments, and practice notebooks.\
The goal is to build a strong foundation in both the practical and
theoretical sides of machine learning.

**Folder meanings:**

-   **projects/** -- complete ML projects organized by type
    (classification, regression).\
-   **math/** -- math notes and derivations for algorithms such as
    gradient descent and the normal equation.\
-   **experiments/** -- quick tests, scratch notebooks, and exploratory
    files.\
-   **each project** contains:
    -   `data/` --- datasets\
    -   `notebooks/` --- Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model building\
    -   optional `src/` for `.py` scripts

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Skills and Tools Used**

-   Python\
-   NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib\
-   scikit-learn\
-   Linear regression and classification models\
-   Feature engineering and preprocessing\
-   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\

## **How to Use This Repository**

1.  Navigate to any project under `projects/`.\
2.  Open the `notebooks/` folder.\
3.  Run the main notebook from top to bottom.\
4.  Ensure datasets are inside the project's `data/` folder.

Each project is self-contained and can be run independently.
